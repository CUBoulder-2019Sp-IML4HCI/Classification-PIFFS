## Ideas and ToDos:

- Make Images same size so they fully overlap when classes change.
- Stop Sound when classes switch. When class 2 (Coffee!!) is present, I don't want to hear the sound from class 1
- Create case for missing Input signal from Face Recognition. If no OSC input goes through, a message and countdown should appear "Return back to your seat. Alarm will go on in 5... 4.... 3.... 2... 1...". If there is still no input after 5 (or10?) seconds, switch to the Alarm class (class 3)
